 I, Mathias Panzenböck, place this file hereby into the public domain.
 Use it at your own risk for whatever you like.  In case there are
 jurisdictions that don't support putting things in the public domain
 you can also consider it to be "dual licensed" under the BSD, MIT and
 Apache licenses, if you want to. This code is trivial anyway. Consider
 it an example on how to get the endian conversion functions on
 different platforms.
